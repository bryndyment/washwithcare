				<h1><span>More About the Project</span></h1>
				<p id="summary">This project aims to raise awareness about the current BC Government's guidelines on how to safely wash clothing that is worn during farm work or pesticide application. Clothing that has been worn in fields where pesticides are used has been found to be one of the major sources of indoor pesticide contamination. Safe handling of these garments can reduce farmers' and farm family members' exposure to pesticides.</p>

						<p class="mt-0">During the first phase of the project, the Wash With Care team will bring together farm community members to talk about the current laundry guidelines during a series of focus groups and interviews. The second phase of the project will involve farm community members taking part in the development of a series of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) that will promote the contaminated clothing laundry guidelines. The third phase of the project will evaluate the effectiveness of the PSAs.</p>
						<p>Given the multicultural nature of the farming community in BC, this project will be undertaken in a number of different languages, starting with Punjabi. If you are interested in learning more about this project, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
