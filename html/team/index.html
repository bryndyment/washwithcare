				<h1><span>Our Research Team</span></h1>
				<p id="summary">This project aims to raise awareness about the current BC Government's guidelines on how to safely wash clothing that is worn during farm work or pesticide application. Clothing that has been worn in fields where pesticides are used has been found to be one of the major sources of indoor pesticide contamination. Safe handling of these garments can reduce farmers' and farm family members' exposure to pesticides.</p>

His primary areas of expertise are retrospective exposure assessment, particularly for epidemiological studies, the role of noise in stress and chronic disease, and the measurement and control of noise in the workplace. He is currently developing an environmental "noise map" of Vancouver as part of a large epidemiologic study investigating the joint effects of traffic-related noise and air pollution on heart disease risk. He also has ongoing research projects involving occupational exposures in a variety of industries including farming, silviculture, tree-falling, and lumber manufacturing. At UBC he teaches courses in chemical and biological measurement, occupational epidemiology, as well as grant-writing skills for an interdisciplinary graduate program ("Bridge") that develops creative evidence-based prevention measures for public, environmental and occupational health problems.</p></td>
